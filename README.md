# parsingSpokenTime

Four files:

1. reanalysisBRMSExp02_22jun21.Rmd = slightly edited RMarkdown file to add more explanatory text.
2. reanalysisBRMSExp02_10may21.pdf = result of knitting the earlier version. Not re-knitted because it takes a long time to run the models. The model code and results start on p. 26.
3. bwCompiledV2_05aug20.csv = the data file.
4. parsingSpokenTimeExp02_22jun21.pdf = current version of the write-up of the second experiment.

Questions:

1. Have I made fundamental mistakes in setting up the model?
2. Is the account of the model results accurate?
3. Is it possible to model dependencies between the responses?
